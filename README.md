# SpotifyAPI

#The code is a simple python program that uses the spotify API to pull data on artists and songs and is already complied. 
#The data is read into a text file that we converted to a .csv for readability. 

# Cadre: Worked on code for regional analysis
# Nima: Collected and combed through the raw data and converted it to CSV format and also helped with the code. 
# Vinny: Using Spotify api and some packages from Pythons Spotify librray, gathered data on artists and countries. Created the code for data gathering.
