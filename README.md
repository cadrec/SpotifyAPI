# SpotifyAPI

#The code is a simple python program that uses the spotify API to pull data on artists and songs and is already complied. 
#The data is read into a text file that we converted to a .csv for readability. 

Instructions: The code itself is a python file and can be compiled and ran inside the terminal. Our personal api keys are in the master branch code so you should be able to compile the program and it will already pull from the spotify api. The output comes in the form of different text files separated by country within the title of the file ie US_Albums is the top albums in the United States. Within the countries it is split into three text file catecogies, output wich is just the raw data of the artist for that country and then the top album data for that artiist and then the top songs for that artist. 
We personally converted the files to a CSV format so it was easier to read and work with. From here we generated graphs based off the results from the data split by country to see how the top artists we chose did around the world. These graphs are also split by country as well. 
One interestong example is how Mexico likes slipknot a deathmetal band, a lot more than they do Led Zepplin or Drake for example. And compare this to United States results where more useres listened to Billie Eilish a pop star and Led Zepplin it just goes to show how different countries and cultures have very different tastes in musci even among the top artists. 

The graphs themselves do not regenerate with the python code beaue that is pulling from the API and the information on users and their likes changes constantly, so to be accurate we just kept the graphs that we have have so the data is not different. 


Every team member just added their contributions here in the master ReadMe as to keep it all centralized. 

# Cadre: Worked on code for regional analysis also created the graphs for the data. 
# Nima: Collected and combed through the raw data and converted it to CSV format and also helped with the regional analysis code and did the poster. 
# Vinny: Using Spotify api and some packages from Pythons Spotify librray, gathered data on artists and countries. Created the code for data gathering.
# Justin: Worked on poster and preparing it for presentation
